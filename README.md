# Your Biomedical Knowledge Assistant üß¨üìö

InsightMed is a powerful, AI-driven tool designed to simplify and accelerate the exploration of scientific articles in the biomedical domain. Whether you're navigating complex literature on topics like MET (Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition) or analyzing treatment trends, this solution provides a streamlined interface to interact with, summarize, and visualize insights from scientific research.

## Features üöÄ

1. Chat with Your Article üó®Ô∏è

    Engage in a conversation with individual research articles. Simply upload a PDF, ask questions, and receive contextually accurate answers based on the content of the article.

    - Configure options such as the number of chunks to retrieve, the search method, and the generation model.
    - Designed to save hours of manual reading and comprehension.

2. Summarize Your Article ‚úçÔ∏è

    Get concise, structured summaries of any uploaded article.

    - Upload the PDF and let the tool extract key insights and generate a summary.
    - Perfect for quickly understanding research without reading every detail.

3. Treatment Visualization Dashboard üìä

    Gain a broader perspective by visualizing data extracted from multiple articles.

    - View trends and features such as treatment mentions, types of cancers addressed, article classifications (e.g., research vs. clinical review), and publication dates.
    - Perform sentiment analysis to identify the most promising treatments based on authors' tones.
    - Color-coded and interactive graphs highlight key insights.
